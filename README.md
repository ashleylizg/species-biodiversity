# species-biodiversity
Calculate species richness and species category distribution within the US National Parks using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

### Available Jupyter Notebooks

**richness**: Find the total number of species and divide that by the number of acres in each park for an estimated species per acre value.

**distribution**: Find the average distribution of the species categories (such as vascular plants, bird, fungi, and insects) in each park and compare across all parks.
